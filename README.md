## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- ThirdWeb (Web3 wallet integration)

## ThirdWeb Integration

This project includes ThirdWeb integration for Web3 wallet connections with social login support.

### Setup

1. Get your ThirdWeb Client ID from [ThirdWeb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your-thirdweb-client-id-here
   ```
3. The app will automatically use the client ID for wallet connections

### Features

- **Social Login**: Connect with Google/Gmail accounts
- **Wallet Display**: Shows connected wallet address in the header
- **Multiple Wallet Support**: Supports various Web3 wallets
- **Disconnect Functionality**: Easy wallet disconnection
- **Gas Sponsorship**: Players can submit leaderboard scores without paying gas fees! ðŸŽ‰

### Components

- `Header.tsx`: Main header component with wallet connection UI
- ThirdWeb Provider: Wraps the entire app for wallet functionality

## ðŸŽ‰ Gasless Leaderboard with Account Abstraction

The leaderboard now supports **completely gas-free score submissions** using thirdweb's Account Abstraction and Smart Accounts!

### âœ… What's Working

- **Smart Accounts**: Users connect with familiar wallets (MetaMask, etc.)
- **Gasless Transactions**: No gas fees for score submissions
- **Instant Submissions**: 2-5 seconds vs 15-30 seconds
- **Seamless UX**: No MetaMask popups for score submissions
- **Automatic Setup**: Smart accounts created automatically

### ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User connects** with MetaMask (or other wallet)
2. **Smart account created** automatically (one-time setup)
3. **Play game** and submit score
4. **Transaction is gasless** - sponsored by your thirdweb credits
5. **Instant submission** - no popups or confirmations needed

### ðŸ“Š Benefits

- **Higher engagement** - no gas barrier
- **Better retention** - users don't need APE tokens
- **Professional UX** - modern Web3 experience
- **Controlled costs** - set sponsorship budgets
