## How It Works

```
Player submits score
        â†“
Transaction prepared
        â†“
Sent to thirdweb bundler
        â†“
Bundler checks sponsorship rules
        â†“
If matched: Paymaster covers gas âœ…
If not matched: Player pays gas (fallback)
        â†“
Transaction submitted on-chain
```

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Configure Gas Sponsorship (Required)

Go to: https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/gas-credits

Create a rule with these settings:
- **Chain**: ApeChain Curtis (33111)
- **Contract**: `0xc2b0fd0536590ef616f361e3a4f6ff15a8e36c51`
- **Function**: `submitScore(uint256)`
- **Budget**: Set reasonable daily/monthly limits

### Step 2: Add Gas Credits

Purchase gas credits in the thirdweb dashboard to fund transactions.

### Step 3: Test

```bash
npm run dev
```

Play the game, submit a score, and verify in console:
```
Score submitted successfully (gas sponsored): 0x...
```

## Technical Details

### Account Abstraction Components

**Bundler**: Routes transactions and applies sponsorship rules
**Paymaster**: Covers gas costs for sponsored transactions
**Your App**: Automatically detects and uses sponsorship

### No Changes Needed For:

âœ… Smart contracts (leaderboard contract unchanged)
âœ… User wallets (works with regular EOAs)
âœ… Frontend UI (transparent to users)
âœ… Game logic (no modifications needed)

### Backward Compatible

- If gas sponsorship is NOT configured â†’ users pay gas (same as before)
- If gas sponsorship IS configured â†’ users get free transactions (new!)
- No breaking changes, fully backward compatible

## Cost Estimates

### Per Transaction
- Gas usage: ~50,000 gas
- Gas price: ~0.1 Gwei (ApeChain Curtis)
- Cost: ~$0.001 - $0.01 per submission

### Monthly Estimates
| Daily Submissions | Monthly Cost |
|------------------|--------------|
| 100              | $3 - $30     |
| 1,000            | $30 - $300   |
| 10,000           | $300 - $3,000|

*Costs vary based on network conditions and APE token price*

## Benefits

### For Players
âœ… No gas fees required to submit scores
âœ… Better UX - no friction in the leaderboard submission flow
âœ… No need to hold APE tokens
âœ… Faster onboarding

### For You
âœ… Higher submission rates (no gas barrier)
âœ… Better player retention
âœ… Controlled costs (set budgets and limits)
âœ… Easy monitoring via dashboard
