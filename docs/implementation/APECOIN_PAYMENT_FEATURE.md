# ApeCoin Payment Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a three-tier play mode system for Banana Fever Dream:

1. **Not Connected**: Users can play for free (no leaderboard ranking)
2. **Practice Mode**: Connected users can play for free (no leaderboard ranking)
3. **Compete Mode**: Users pay 0.1 APE to play and rank on leaderboard

## What Was Implemented

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. CoinSlot Contract (`contracts/CoinSlot.sol`)
- **Purpose**: Accepts 0.1 APE payments for competitive play
- **Key Functions**:
  - `playGame()` - Payable function requiring exactly 0.1 APE
  - `hasActivePayment(address)` - Check if player has paid
  - `clearPayment(address)` - Clear payment status after game
  - `withdraw()` - Owner withdraws accumulated funds
  - `getBalance()` - View contract balance
- **Features**:
  - Payment tracking per player
  - Events for monitoring (GamePaid, Withdrawal, PaymentCleared)
  - Owner-only withdrawal function
  - Ownership transfer capability

#### 2. Updated Leaderboard Contract (`contracts/Leaderboard.sol`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `ICoinSlot` interface integration
  - Added `onlyPaidPlayers` modifier
  - Updated `submitScore()` to require payment verification
  - Automatically clears payment after successful score submission
  - Added `setCoinSlotAddress()` for owner to link contracts
  - Added `transferOwnership()` function
- **Security**: Only accepts scores from players who paid via CoinSlot

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Type System (`src/types/game.ts`)
- Added `PlayMode` type: `'not-connected' | 'practice' | 'compete'`
- Added `playMode` field to `GameState` interface

#### 2. CoinSlot Hook (`src/hooks/useCoinSlot.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages ApeCoin payment transactions
- **Functions**:
  - `payToPlay()` - Send 0.1 APE payment with gas sponsorship
  - `checkActivePayment()` - Verify payment status
  - `clearPayment()` - Clear payment after game
- **State**:
  - `isPaying` - Payment transaction in progress
  - `error` - Payment error message
  - `hasActivePay` - Current payment status
  - `isConnected` - Wallet connection status

#### 3. Updated Game State Hook (`src/hooks/useGameState.ts`)
- **Changes**:
  - Initialize `playMode: 'not-connected'` in initial state
  - Updated `startGame(mode: PlayMode)` to accept play mode parameter
  - Preserve play mode when resetting to ready state
- **Behavior**: Game state now tracks which mode player is in

#### 4. Updated Leaderboard Hook (`src/hooks/useLeaderboard.ts`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `playMode` parameter to `submitScore()`
  - Only submits scores when `playMode === 'compete'`
  - Logs message when practice mode scores are not submitted
- **Security**: Frontend validation before blockchain submission

#### 5. Updated GameOver Component (`src/components/game/GameOver.tsx`)
- **Changes**:
  - Auto-submit only for compete mode games
  - Updated messages based on play mode:
    - Not connected: "Log in and insert a coin to compete"
    - Practice mode: "Insert a coin to compete"
    - Compete mode: Shows submission status
- **Behavior**: Clear feedback about why scores aren't being saved

#### 6. Updated BananaFeverDream Component (`src/components/game/BananaFeverDream.tsx`)
- **Major UI Restructuring**:
  
  **Before:**
  ```
  [START GAME] [LEADERBOARD] [INFO] [FEEDBACK]
  ```

  **After:**
  ```
  [LEADERBOARD] [INFO] [FEEDBACK]

  [Score Card] [Health Card] [Fever Card]

  [Game Canvas]

  [INSERT COIN] [PRACTICE]  [Controls]
  ```

- **New Features**:
  - "INSERT COIN" button triggers payment flow
  - "PRACTICE" button starts free play (no payment)
  - Navigation buttons moved above game info cards
  - Game control buttons remain below canvas
  - Payment status feedback via toasts
  - INSERT COIN button disabled when not connected
  - Loading state during payment processing

- **Payment Flow**:
  1. User clicks "INSERT COIN"
  2. System checks wallet connection
  3. Triggers 0.1 APE payment with gas sponsorship
  4. On success: Starts game in compete mode
  5. On failure: Shows error message
  6. Practice button always available for free play

#### 7. Configuration (`src/lib/thirdweb.ts`)
- Added `COINSLOT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` export
- Default to zero address (needs to be set after deployment)

### Documentation

#### 1. CoinSlot Gas Sponsorship Setup (`docs/setup/COINSLOT_GAS_SPONSORSHIP.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Contract deployment steps
- Environment configuration
- Gas sponsorship setup in thirdweb dashboard
- Testing procedures
- Production deployment considerations
- Security best practices
- Cost estimation
- Revenue management
- Troubleshooting guide
- Monitoring and analytics

## Current Implementation: Hybrid Approach

**Payment**: Personal account (EOA) pays 0.1 APE + gas
**Submission**: Smart account submits with gas sponsorship

See `docs/setup/HYBRID_PAYMENT_FLOW.md` for detailed explanation.

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Contracts

```bash
# Deploy CoinSlot
npx thirdweb deploy contracts/CoinSlot.sol

# Deploy updated Leaderboard
npx thirdweb deploy contracts/Leaderboard.sol
```

### 2. Link Contracts

After deployment:
1. Call `setCoinSlotAddress()` on Leaderboard contract
2. Pass the CoinSlot contract address
3. Verify the link is successful

### 3. Update Environment

Create or update `.env` file:

```env
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_COINSLOT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x<deployed-coinslot-address>
VITE_LEADERBOARD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x<deployed-leaderboard-address>
```

### 4. Configure Gas Sponsorship

In thirdweb dashboard, create TWO sponsorship rules:

**Rule 1: CoinSlot Payments**
- Contract: CoinSlot address
- Function: `playGame()`
- Budget: $5-10/day recommended for testing

**Rule 2: Leaderboard Submissions**
- Contract: Leaderboard address  
- Function: `submitScore(uint256,address)`
- Budget: Keep existing budget

### 5. Test All Three Modes

**Test Case 1: Not Connected**
- [ ] Can play game
- [ ] No "INSERT COIN" button available
- [ ] Game over shows: "Log in and insert a coin to compete"
- [ ] Score NOT submitted to leaderboard

**Test Case 2: Practice Mode**
- [ ] Log in
- [ ] Click "PRACTICE" button
- [ ] Game starts without payment
- [ ] Can play normally
- [ ] Game over shows: "Insert a coin to compete"
- [ ] Score NOT submitted to leaderboard

**Test Case 3: Compete Mode**
- [ ] Log in with 0.1+ APE
- [ ] Click "INSERT COIN" button
- [ ] Payment modal appears
- [ ] Approve 0.1 APE transaction (gas sponsored)
- [ ] Payment success toast appears
- [ ] Game starts in compete mode
- [ ] Play and finish game
- [ ] Score auto-submits to leaderboard (gas sponsored)
- [ ] Game over shows: "Score submitted successfully"
- [ ] Verify score appears on leaderboard

### 6. Verify Gas Sponsorship

Check that both transactions had gas paid by paymaster:
1. Find transactions on ApeChain Curtis explorer
2. Look for "Sponsored by" or paymaster indicator
3. Verify user only paid 0.1 APE (not gas fees)

### 7. Test Error Cases

**Insufficient Balance**
- [ ] Try INSERT COIN with < 0.1 APE
- [ ] Should show appropriate error message

**Network Issues**
- [ ] Test with poor connectivity
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling

**User Cancellation**
- [ ] Click INSERT COIN then cancel transaction
- [ ] Should return to ready state

### 8. Production Checklist

Before mainnet deployment:
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet (ApeChain, not Curtis)
- [ ] Update environment variables for mainnet
- [ ] Configure mainnet gas sponsorship rules
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits (1 payment/hour/wallet)
- [ ] Set daily/monthly budget limits
- [ ] Enable budget alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%
- [ ] Verify contracts on block explorer
- [ ] Test with small amounts first
- [ ] Monitor costs closely for first week
- [ ] Set up withdrawal schedule for revenue

## Architecture Overview

```
Player Interaction Flow:
1. Player clicks "INSERT COIN"
2. useCoinSlot.payToPlay() → CoinSlot.playGame()
3. 0.1 APE transferred to CoinSlot contract
4. hasActivePay[player] = true
5. Game starts in compete mode

6. Player plays game
7. Game ends, score recorded

8. useLeaderboard.submitScore() → Leaderboard.submitScore()
9. Contract checks CoinSlot.hasActivePayment(player)
10. If true: Save score, emit event
11. Clear payment: CoinSlot.clearPayment(player)
12. Score appears on leaderboard

Practice Flow:
1. Player clicks "PRACTICE"
2. Game starts in practice mode (no payment)
3. Player plays game
4. Game ends, score NOT submitted
5. User sees "Insert a coin to compete"
```

## Gas Sponsorship Flow

```
Payment Transaction:
User → Frontend → CoinSlot.playGame() → Thirdweb Paymaster → ApeChain
                  (0.1 APE)            (gas fees)

Score Submission:
User → Frontend → Leaderboard.submitScore() → Thirdweb Paymaster → ApeChain
                  (checks payment)                   (gas fees)
```

## Cost Structure

### Player Costs
- **Compete Mode**: 0.1 APE (gas sponsored)
- **Practice Mode**: Free (no transaction)

### Developer Costs (Gas Sponsorship)
- **Per Payment**: ~$0.001 - $0.01
- **Per Score Submission**: ~$0.001 - $0.01
- **1000 Daily Players**: $2 - $20/day

### Revenue
- **Per Player**: 0.1 APE (~$0.10 - $1.00 depending on APE price)
- **1000 Daily Players**: 100 APE collected

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Payment verification before score submission
- ✅ Owner-only withdrawal function
- ✅ Payment clearing after use
- ✅ Zero address checks
- ✅ Exact payment amount required

### Frontend Security
