# Leaderboard Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Smart Contract (`/contracts/BananaLeaderboard.sol`)
- **Solidity 0.8.20** smart contract for on-chain score storage
- **Features:**
  - Stores all scores with wallet addresses (smart wallet + original wallet)
  - On-chain validation: score > 0
  - Events emitted for score submissions
  - Tracks original wallet addresses for consistent user identification
  - Extensible struct for future enhancements
  - Off-chain sorting support via `getAllScores()`

### 2. TypeScript Types (`/src/types/leaderboard.ts`)
- `LeaderboardEntry` interface (includes originalWallet field)
- `LeaderboardState` interface for state management

### 3. React Hooks

#### `useLeaderboard.ts`
- **ThirdWeb Integration** for Web3 interactions
- **Functions:**
  - `submitScore(score)` - Submit score to blockchain with original wallet address
  - `fetchLeaderboard()` - Fetch and sort all scores
  - `getPlayerScore(address)` - Get specific player's score
- **State Management:**
  - `isLoading` - Loading state
  - `isSubmitting` - Transaction pending state
  - `error` - Error messages
  - `isConnected` - Wallet connection status

#### `useWalletAddresses.ts` (New)
- **Centralized wallet address management**
- **Returns:**
  - `originalWalletAddress` - The original EOA wallet address
  - `formattedOriginalAddress` - Formatted original address (0x1234...5678)
  - `isConnected` - Connection status
  - `formatAddress()` - Utility function for formatting addresses
- **Purpose:** Provides original wallet address for users with smart wallets, ensuring consistent user identification across the app

### 4. Leaderboard Page (`/src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`)
- **Full-screen route at `/leaderboard`**
- **Features:**
  - Top 20 player display with beautiful UI
  - **Displays original wallet addresses** (not smart wallet addresses)
  - Rank badges (gold/silver/bronze for top 3)
  - User's rank highlighted if on leaderboard (matched by original wallet)
  - Shows user's rank even if outside top 20
  - Real-time refresh button
  - Connection status alerts
  - Responsive design

### 5. Header Component (`/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)
- **Displays original wallet address** for consistent user identification
- Shows the address of the original EOA wallet (for smart wallet users)
- Seamlessly works with both smart wallets and regular wallets

### 6. Game Integration

#### BananaFeverDream Component
- Added "LEADERBOARD" button that navigates to `/leaderboard`

#### GameOver Component
- **Auto-submit scores** when game ends (if wallet connected)
- **Submits with original wallet address** for consistent identification
- **Status indicators:**
  - Warning if wallet not connected
  - Loading state during submission
  - Success confirmation after submission
- **Toast notifications** with direct link to leaderboard
- Added "LEADERBOARD" button to view rankings

### 7. Routing (`/src/App.tsx`)
- Added `/leaderboard` route
- Imported Leaderboard page component

## 🚀 Next Steps (To Deploy)

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contract
See `LEADERBOARD_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

**Quick Start:**
1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create new file and paste `/contracts/BananaLeaderboard.sol`
3. Compile with Solidity 0.8.20+
4. Deploy to ApeChain Curtis Testnet (Chain ID: 33111)
5. Copy deployed contract address

### Step 2: Update Contract Address
Edit `/src/hooks/useLeaderboard.ts`:
```typescript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourDeployedContractAddress";
```

### Step 3: Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Test the flow:
1. Connect wallet
2. Play game
3. Check score auto-submission on game over
4. Navigate to `/leaderboard`
5. Verify your score appears in rankings

## 🎮 User Flow

### For Connected Users:
1. User connects wallet via Header
2. User plays game
3. On game over:
   - Score automatically submitted to blockchain
   - Toast notification with success/failure
   - "View Leaderboard" action in toast
4. User can click "LEADERBOARD" button anytime
5. Leaderboard shows user's rank and top 20

### For Guest Users:
1. User plays without connecting wallet
2. On game over:
   - Warning message: "Connect wallet to save scores"
3. User can still view leaderboard
4. Leaderboard shows top 20 with connection prompt

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Blockchain Integration
- **Network:** ApeChain Curtis Testnet (33111)
- **RPC:** https://33111.rpc.thirdweb.com
- **Currency:** APE (testnet)
- **SDK:** ThirdWeb v5

### On-Chain Validation
- Score must be > 0
- New score must exceed previous best
- Only player can submit their own score
- Transaction reverts if validation fails

### Off-Chain Features
- Sorting performed in frontend (gas savings)
- Top 20 limit for display performance
- Real-time leaderboard updates
- Cached data with manual refresh

## 📊 Data Structure

### Smart Contract Storage
```solidity
struct ScoreEntry {
    address player;           // Smart wallet address
    address originalWallet;   // Original EOA wallet address
    uint256 score;
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 entryId;
}
```

### Frontend State
```typescript
interface LeaderboardEntry {
    player: string;          // Smart wallet address
    originalWallet: string;  // Original EOA wallet address (displayed in UI)
    score: number;           // Final score
    timestamp: number;       // When achieved
    rank?: number;           // Position (1-based)
}
```

## 🔑 Original Wallet Tracking

### Why Track Original Wallets?

When users connect with smart wallets (Account Abstraction), they have two addresses:
1. **Smart Wallet Address** - Changes between sessions/devices
2. **Original Wallet Address** - Consistent EOA (like MetaMask address)

The leaderboard displays the **original wallet address** to provide:
- ✅ Consistent user identification across sessions
- ✅ Recognizable addresses for users
- ✅ Proper "You" badge highlighting
- ✅ Better UX for players with smart wallets

### How It Works

1. User connects wallet (MetaMask, in-app wallet, etc.)
2. `useWalletAddresses` hook detects if it's a smart wallet
3. If smart wallet: extracts original wallet via `useAdminWallet()`
4. If regular wallet: uses the account address directly
5. Original wallet address is submitted with each score
6. UI displays only the original wallet address throughout the app

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Leaderboard Page
- Clean, modern table layout
- Top 3 special badges (🏆 🥈 🥉)
- User highlight (if on leaderboard)
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Responsive design
- Dark mode compatible

### GameOver Screen
- Connection status indicators
- Transaction progress feedback
- Success/error toasts
- Quick navigation to leaderboard

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The contract is designed to be extensible. You can easily add:
- Level reached
- Waves survived
- Time played
- Power-ups used
- Achievement badges
- Seasonal leaderboards
- Team competitions

To extend:
1. Update `ScoreEntry` struct in contract
2. Deploy new version
3. Update TypeScript types
4. Modify UI to display new fields

## 📝 Notes

- Guest mode (no wallet) is fully supported for gameplay
- Only connected users can submit scores
- Scores are permanent and verifiable on-chain
- Gas costs are minimal (testnet APE is free)
- Contract is upgradeable by deploying new version
- Consider adding pausable/admin features for mainnet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check:
1. Contract address is correctly set in `useLeaderboard.ts`
2. Wallet is connected to Curtis Testnet
3. User has testnet APE for gas fees
4. ThirdWeb client ID is set in `.env`
5. Browser console for detailed errors
